# Chronicling America Price Dataset

**255,518 structured price records extracted from condensed 112 American newspapers, 1770-1963.**

This is a simple test LLM analysis of condensed news and magazine articles from the Library of Congress [Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/) digital newspaper archive. It is not the target analysis, only a smoke test of the data's usability.

The Chronicling America dataset is the result of a scanning and digitization project by the Library of Congress, covering almost 200 years of American
history, and it has strong potential for LLM analysis. Unfortunately, digitization is still incomplete; the completed OCR is noisy and contains
errors, and the sheer volume is too large for convenient processing.

In this phase, I downloaded all converted data. Where text was unavailable, I completed OCR of the remaining pages and used the gpt-5-mini
model to condense and denoise the text. This transformation preserves all facts while reducing token volume to less than 20% of the original size. This makes the
following LLM analyses much cheaper and faster.

To test the data, I've further extracted all price references and normalized them to USD. Unexpected or deviating values were automatically re-analyzed and either corrected or flagged and excluded as outliers. The resulting dataset contains 255,518 structured price
records with commodity classification, standardized units, and confidence scores.

## Motivation

Historical price data before the 20th century is sparse, inconsistent, and trapped in unstructured sources. Government price indices (BLS, NBER) begin reliably only around 1890. Newspaper advertisements and market reports contain rich price information going back to the colonial era - but extracting it at scale requires reading millions of pages of noisy OCR text.

This project applies modern LLMs to that problem: reading OCR text, denoising it, identifying price mentions, classifying commodities, standardizing units, and converting currencies - producing a clean JSONL dataset ready for quantitative analysis.

## Data

The LLM-compressed OCR text (pass 0) is published as a GitHub release artifact:

**[Download pass0_compressed_ocr.tar.gz (~265 MB)](https://github.com/petr-salomoun/chronicling-america-prices/releases/tag/v1.0)**

This archive contains the denoised and compressed OCR for all 112 newspapers (1770–1963), reduced to ~20% of the original token volume while preserving all facts. It is the primary output of Stage 1 and represents the main LLM processing cost of this project.

The raw OCR pages (`raw_ocr_pages.tar.gz`, ~1.4 GB) can be freely re-downloaded from the [Library of Congress Chronicling America API](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/) at no LLM cost using the provided `download_chronicling_america.py` script.

The final normalized price records (`data/pass2/prices/normalized.jsonl`) are regenerated from the compressed OCR by running the extraction and normalization pipeline (see `GUIDE.md`). The normalized dataset was not republished as an artifact because it is fully reproducible from the compressed OCR above.

## Pipeline

The extraction pipeline has four stages, each using LLM calls with structured output:

**Stage 0 - Download:** Fetch OCR text pages from the LOC Chronicling America API for all available newspapers in the target year range.

**Stage 1 - Compress:** The LLM reads raw OCR, which is often garbled, and produces clean compressed text. It reduces data volume to about 20% of the original token count while preserving all facts (names, prices, numerals).

**Stage 2 - Extract:** The LLM identifies individual price mentions in the compressed text and outputs structured records with commodity, price, unit, date, and location.

**Stage 3 - Normalize:** The LLM classifies each extracted mention into a 79-commodity taxonomy, standardizes units (bushels, pounds, barrels, etc.), converts historical currencies to USD, and assigns confidence scores. Statistical QC filters apply physical price bounds and outlier removal.

Each stage supports parallelization (`--workers N`) and checkpoint/resume via progress files.

## Demo Analysis: What Can You Do With This Data?

The following analysis demonstrates the dataset's utility for economic history research. Several hypotheses were tested quantitatively:

### Food prices track every American war

![Flour Prices Across All Wars](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petr-salomoun/chronicling-america-prices/master/report_figures/fig3_flour_all_wars.png)

Civil War flour: **+196%**. WWI wheat: **+132%**, flour: **+263%**. WWII (with OPA controls): only +25% — suggesting price controls worked, though inflation surged +96% immediately after they were lifted.

### The Great Depression collapsed agricultural prices

![Food Staple Prices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petr-salomoun/chronicling-america-prices/master/report_figures/fig4_food_staples.png)

Wheat fell **-59%**, butter **-58%**, and pork **-43%** between 1925-29 and 1930-34.

### The Gold Standard stabilized prices

Wheat price CV during the gold standard (1879-1914): **0.254**. Afterward: **0.466**. The post-gold era was **1.8x more volatile**.

### Railroads integrated markets

![Wheat Price Dispersion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petr-salomoun/chronicling-america-prices/master/report_figures/fig9_wheat_dispersion.png)

Wheat price dispersion fell **41%** from the pre-railroad era (1820-50) to the mature network (1890-1910).

### Agricultural expansion deflated grain prices

Wheat dropped **38%** and corn **32%** between 1880-85 and 1895-1900 as homesteading opened the Great Plains.

### Volatility varies by economic category

![Volatility by Category](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petr-salomoun/chronicling-america-prices/master/report_figures/fig6_volatility.png)

Raw materials are the most volatile; wages are the stickiest.

### Composite price index reveals the full arc
